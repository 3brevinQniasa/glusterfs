A generic product key is a default key that allows you to install or upgrade to a specific Windows 10 edition, but does not activate it. You can use a generic product key for evaluation or testing purposes, or if you have a digital license or a genuine product key that you will enter later. In this article, we will show you how to find and use a generic product key for Windows 10 Single Language Edition.
 
## Step 1: Find a generic product key for Windows 10 Single Language Edition
 
There are different sources where you can find generic product keys for Windows 10 editions, such as Microsoft's official websites[^1^] [^2^] or third-party websites[^3^] [^4^]. However, you should always be careful when using third-party websites, as they may contain malware or inaccurate information. For your convenience, we have listed the generic product keys for Windows 10 Single Language Edition below:
 
- Windows 10 Home Single Language: BT79Q-G7N6G-PGBYW-4YWX6-6F4BT
- Windows 10 Home Single Language N: 7HNRX-D7KGG-3K4RQ-4WPJ4-YTDFH
- Windows 10 Home Single Language with Bing: PVMJN-6DFY6-9CCP6-7BKTT-D3WVR

Note that these generic product keys are not edition-specific, meaning that you can use them to install any Windows 10 Home edition, including Single Language.

## Step 2: Create a Windows 10 installation media
 
To install Windows 10 Single Language Edition on a different PC, you will need to create a Windows 10 installation media using a USB flash drive, a DVD, or an ISO file. To do this, you will need to download and run the media creation tool from Microsoft's website[^2^]. You will also need to have a license to install Windows 10, which you can purchase from Microsoft's website[^2^] or from an authorized retailer.
 
Once you have downloaded the media creation tool, follow these steps:

1. Run the tool as an administrator and accept the license terms.
2. Select Create installation media (USB flash drive, DVD, or ISO file) for another PC and click Next.
3. Select the language, edition, and architecture (64-bit or 32-bit) for Windows 10. If you want to install Windows 10 Single Language Edition, make sure to select the appropriate language and edition from the drop-down menus. You can also check the box Use the recommended options for this PC to automatically select the options based on your current PC.
4. Select which media you want to use: USB flash drive (requires at least 8 GB of space) or ISO file (requires a DVD burner and a blank DVD). Click Next.
5. If you chose USB flash drive, select the drive from the list and click Next. The tool will download and copy the Windows 10 files to the drive. If you chose ISO file, select a location to save the file and click Save. The tool will download and create the ISO file. You can then burn it to a DVD using a third-party software.
6. When the process is complete, click Finish and remove the USB flash drive or DVD from your PC.
